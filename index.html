      <p>I am orgiinally from Cleveland, Ohio but moved down to North Carolina in 2011. I received a B.S. in Mathematis from NC State in 2014. Howeer, the work that I have done since graduating has been mostly in the field of both inside and outside sales. I recently decided that I needed a career change and that I wanted to be able to utilize my math skills.</p>

      <p>I am very interested in programming and what career options will open up for me upon completion of the Bootcamp. I am certain which direction I will decide to go in but one of the things I enjoy about this camp so much is the magnitude of opportunities that will be available.</p>
