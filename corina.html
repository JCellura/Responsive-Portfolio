      <p style="font-style: italic" >I wrote you this poem.. I dont pretend to be a poet by a long shot and it's a little corny but I hope it can make you smile....</p>

      <p> In writing this I didn't know where to start, <br>
          I guess it's best to just speak from the heart. <br>
      </p>

      <p> Accepting the reality of loosing you, <br>
        by far the hardest thing I've ever had to do. <br>
      </p>

      <p> The love I have for you is something that can't be measured, <br>
          Waking up next to you is a though that's forever treasured. <br>
      </p>

      <p> The memories in my head in something I cannot ditch <br>
          Like the weekend at the beach when Meredith was acting like a ... <br>
      </p>

      <p> They say it takes loosing something to know what you had, <br>
          Just thinking about that makes me incredibly sad. <br>
      </p>

      <p> I know you've said over and over you need time and space, <br>
          But the thought of us together is something god himself cant replace. <br>
      </p>

      <p> I'd do anything to be able to to go back in time and make things right, <br>
          Anything to avoid what happened that night, avoid that awful fight. <br>
      </p>

      <p> I didn't truly know what the word love meant until we met, <br>
          Just a simple day at a backyard party that I'll never forget. <br>
      </p>

      <p> Your fear that things will just be more of the same, <br>
        All of the terrible things that I did to drive you insane. <br>
      </p>

      <p> Sleeping too much, not talking to you and being lazy; <br>
          I understand exactly what I did to drive you away, drive you crazy <br>
      </p>

      <p> I could make more promises of me changing but you know its only words,<br>
          My actions will become the reality and not sentences you've already heard.
    </p>

      <p> You've heard me say that I wish it didn't take loosing you; <br>
          Just to understand how much personal work that I had to do. <br>
      </p>

      <p> I'd do anything to again have you by my side, <br>
          For a chance to change of the things that made you stay up late and cry. <br>
      </p>

      <p> You deserve to have a happy, wonderful life; <br>
          You deserve to feel the love a husband has for his wife. <br>
      </p>

      <p> From the smell of your hair as you lay next to me,  <br>
          To the constant love that you show my best friend, Remy. <br>
      </p>

      <p> I could go on for days listing the reasons I fell in love, <br>
          I know now that you were a gift from the man up above. <br>
      </p>

      <p> You said that you came into my life at the worst time and maybe its true, <br>
          I don't want to even think about where I'd be if it weren't for you. <br>
      </p>

      <p> It's my turn to be there for you in any of times of need, <br>
          I promise to always do my best, even if I do not succeed. <br>
      </p>

      <p> I realize that I am asking you for a lot, <br>
          But the reality is; this Love isnt something thats going to stop. <br>
      </p>

      <p> I love everything about you from head to toe, <br>
          Especially your crazy hair that can quickly turn into an afro. <br>
      </p>

      <p> Your beautiful face, amazing smile and tiny little accent, <br>
          When god created you it definitely an accident.<br>
      </p>

      <p> I can't stop fighting even though times are rough,<br>
          I love you Corina and I'm not going to give up.  <br>
    </p>

        <p>There should be so many more pictures here, but the memories in my head are going to be there forever. All I am hoping for is a chance to add to them. Another chance to fall in love all over again.</p>
        <p>I can't change the past but a future without you is a pale shade in comparison.</p>
